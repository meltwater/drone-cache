0. **PLEASE DO NOT INTRODUCE BREAKING CHANGES**
1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this

2. Ensure [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) is up-to-date with new version changes.
3. Update version references.
4. Create a tag on master. Any changes on master will trigger a release with given tag and `latest tag.

    ```console
    $ git tag -am 'vX.X.X'
    > ...
    $ git push --tags
    > ...
    ```

> **Keep in mind that users usually use the `latest` tagged images in their pipeline, please make sure you do not interfere with their working workflow.**
