## Release Process

*Only concerns maintainers/code owners*

0. **PLEASE DO NOT INTRODUCE BREAKING CHANGES**
1. Execute `make README.md`. This will update [usage](README.md#usage) section of [README.md](README.md) with latest CLI options
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   the release would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/meltwater/drone-cache/tags).

3. Ensure [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) is up-to-date with new version changes.
4. Update version references.
5. Create a tag on the master. Any changes on the master will trigger a release with the given tag and `latest tag.

    ```console
    $ git tag -am 'vX.X.X'
    > ...
    $ git push --tags
    > ...
    ```
6. Check whether all the generate artifacts in-place properly.
7. Update [plugin index](https://github.com/drone/drone-plugin-index/blob/master/content/meltwater/drone-cache/index.md) using [DOCS](./DOCS.md).

> **Keep in mind that users usually use the `latest` tagged images in their pipeline, please make sure you do not interfere with their working workflow.**

## Testing Locally

Want to test locally without opening a PR?  Follow the steps below to build a local image of drone-cache and run the Drone pipeline against it.

0. Make sure you have the [Drone CLI](https://docs.drone.io/cli/install/),  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) installed locally.
1. Update the `image_templates` key in `drone-cache/.goreleaser-local.yml`  to reflect the name you'd like your image to have, then run `goreleaser release --config=.goreleaser-local.yml --snapshot --skip-publish --rm-dist` to build the image.
2. Update the `image: drone-cache:MyTestTag` entries in the `local-pipeline` pipeline in the `.drone.yml` with the name of the image that you created (there are several of these).
3. Run the Drone pipeline locally with `drone exec ./.drone-local.yml --branch MyBranchName`
